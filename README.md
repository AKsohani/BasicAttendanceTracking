BasicAttendanceTracking

# Project Description
BasicAttendanceTracking is a simple decentralized system to create events and track attendance on the blockchain. It allows event organizers to register events, and attendees to mark their presence transparently and immutably.

# Project Vision
Build a trustless attendance tracking platform using blockchain technology to eliminate manual errors, prevent fraudulent attendance claims, and remove reliance on a central authority.

* Key Features 
Create Events: Register events with details like name, date, and organizer address.

Attendance Marking: Attendees can mark their attendance only after the event's scheduled start time.

Attendance Query: View attendance status for any participant.

On-Chain Records: All attendance data is stored transparently and immutably on the blockchain.


* Future Scope
- Integration with identity verification to prevent fake attendance.
- QR code or NFC-based check-in systems linked with the smart contract.
- Attendance rewards or incentives for participants.
- Analytics dashboard for event organizers to monitor participation
